#  **Handwriteen digit recognition--Neural network**
This program can recognize letters drawn on the screen. The recgonition is basen on neural network.
In this project I have developed the "classical" neural network example: Recognizing digits using the MNIST database. The network has to be trained using this dataset. After training, the neural network can be tested on a testset and it should give reasonable answers. 

## **Requirements:**

- python3+
- scipy/numpy
- matplotlib
- glob etc
